### The Exploit
Holding a looting-enchanted sword right after firing an arrow with a bow will apply the looting effect to the arrow.



### Purpose
The purpose of this addon (Minecraft / LabyMod / 1.8.9) is to automate the process of shooting an arrow and performing the exploit, in an infinite loop. The key here is that one is able to minimize the game whilst the expolit is performed.
